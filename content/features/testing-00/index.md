From a user/developer standpoint, Netlify CMS running a local environment should work like so:

1. Run my site locally
2. Navigate to the CMS on my locally served site
3. The CMS detects that it is running locally
4. The CMS automatically activates local development mode (breaking change)
5. Any work in the CMS affects local files

For most use cases, this should "just work", out of the box.
